### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Real-time physics simulation  
- Particle systems (velocity, mass, drag, gravity)  
- Mouse-based force fields (repulsion & attraction)  
- Alpha-based trail rendering using `pygame`  
- Smooth visuals using frame-based updates  
- Emergent behavior in dynamic systems

### 💡 Project Overview  
**ParticleFlow** is a real-time particle physics simulator where hundreds of glowing particles move across the screen, responding to gravity, drag, collisions, and interactive mouse forces.

Move your mouse to push particles away — or **hold SPACE** to attract them like a gravitational well.  
The resulting motion looks like flowing energy fields, star clusters, or glowing fluid dynamics.

Every run feels alive, unpredictable, and visually hypnotic.

### ⚙️ Features
✅ 300+ particles with individual velocity, mass & color  
✅ Gravity + drag + bouncing edges  
✅ Mouse repulsion (default)  
✅ Mouse attraction (hold **SPACE**)  
✅ Soft neon-like trails using alpha blending  
✅ Pure single-file project (`main.py`)  
✅ No external assets or folders required
