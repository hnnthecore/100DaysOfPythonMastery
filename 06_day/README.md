# 🎯 Day 6 – The Number Guessing Game

> *"The mind that learns to predict learns to solve."*

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- `while` loops for continuous gameplay  
- Conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else`  
- Using the `random` module to generate unpredictable outcomes  
- Input validation and error handling  
- Logical flow control and replay structure  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
In this project, you’ll build a **Number Guessing Game** where the computer selects a secret number between 1 and 100 — and the player must guess it using logic and intuition.  

After each guess, the program provides feedback:  
- "Too high!" 📈  
- "Too low!" 📉  
- "You got it right in X attempts!" 🏆  

It’s a great exercise to practice **loops**, **input handling**, and **user feedback systems**, all while having fun.
