## 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Behavioral pattern analysis using Python  
- Detecting bias in human-generated randomness  
- Sequence analysis and streak detection  
- Heuristic-based decision making  
- Event-driven GUI programming with Tkinter  
- Translating cognitive science into code

## 💡 Project Overview
**Human Randomness Detector** is a fun psychology-inspired experiment that challenges users to generate a “random” sequence.

The application analyzes the sequence using behavioral heuristics such as:
- Repetition avoidance  
- Alternation bias  
- Distribution imbalance  
- Streak length patterns  

Based on these signals, the program predicts whether the sequence was likely created by a **human** or resembles **machine-generated randomness**.
