# 🧭 Day 100 – PyOS: The Python Operating System

> *“Learning to code is writing programs. Mastery is designing systems.”*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- System-level thinking and architecture  
- Event-driven program design  
- Modular command-based interfaces  
- State and memory management  
- Rule-based decision engines  
- AI-inspired reasoning (non-ML)  
- Logging and observability  
- Orchestrating multiple subsystems  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
**PyOS (Python Operating System)** is a symbolic, interactive system built entirely in Python to represent the culmination of **100 days of learning**.

Instead of ending the journey with a single tool or application, PyOS acts as a **mini operating environment** that brings together:

- A command shell  
- Memory storage  
- Event processing  
- Decision-making logic  
- AI-style knowledge reasoning  
- System logging and status monitoring  

This project is not about features — it is about **flow, structure, and thinking in systems**.

PyOS represents how all individual concepts learned throughout the challenge come together into one cohesive whole.

### 🧩 Sample Output
![PyOS Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hnnthecore/100DaysOfPythonMastery/refs/heads/main/assets/day100_output.png)

- Interactive shell with system commands  
- Live event generation and logging  
- Stored memory recall  
- Decision engine recommendations  
- AI-style question answering  
- Real-time system status reporting  

Each command reflects a different phase of the learning journey.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Design a system instead of a single script  
- Coordinate multiple logical components  
- Manage state, memory, and events together  
- Build explainable AI-style reasoning without ML  
- Think like a software architect, not just a coder  
- Translate learning into structure and design  

This project demonstrates **engineering maturity**, not just syntax knowledge.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed  
2. Run PyOS:
   ```bash
   python main.py
