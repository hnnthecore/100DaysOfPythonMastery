### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- State-based simulation systems  
- Decision → consequence modeling  
- Game-loop architecture  
- Random event generation  
- Attribute-based character modeling  
- Separation of engine logic and game data  
- Designing systems instead of screens

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Life Simulator Engine** is a logic-driven simulation that models how everyday decisions affect a character’s life over time.

The player controls a character with core attributes such as:
- Health  
- Money  
- Happiness  
- Energy  

Each action (work, rest, study, party, invest) alters these attributes and may trigger random life events. Poor decisions can gradually lead to failure, while balanced choices allow the character to survive and progress.

This project is **not a web app** — it is a **simulation engine**, focused entirely on logic, systems, and consequences.

### 🧩 Sample Output
![Life Simulator Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hnnthecore/100DaysOfPythonMastery/refs/heads/main/assets/day84_output.png)

- Real-time stat changes after every decision  
- Random life events affecting outcomes  
- Multiple paths leading to success or failure  
- Game-over conditions based on poor resource management  

This demonstrates a complete **decision → simulation → outcome** loop.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Model complex systems using simple rules  
- Design decision-based engines  
- Implement state machines and game loops  
- Introduce randomness without chaos  
- Separate data definitions from core logic  
- Think in terms of systems, not CRUD flows  

This project builds **simulation and engine-thinking**, skills used in games, AI systems, and strategic modeling.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Make sure Python is installed  
2. Run the simulator:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Choose actions and observe how your life evolves
4. Balance decisions carefully to avoid game over
