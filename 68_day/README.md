> *"Real applications collect real input — carefully."*


### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Handling multi-field HTML forms in Flask  
- Processing POST requests with multiple inputs

### 💡 Project Overview
This project is the **first complete, real-world style Flask mini application** in the series.

A fully functional **Contact Form System** is built where users can:
- Enter their name, email, and message  
- Submit the form using a POST request  
- Receive clear validation feedback for each field  
- See a success message upon valid submission  

The project focuses on **backend-controlled validation**, ensuring data is checked securely before being accepted.

- Empty or invalid fields trigger specific error messages  
- User input is preserved when validation fails  
- Valid submissions show a success confirmation  
- Clean Bootstrap layout improves user experience  

This demonstrates a complete **form lifecycle** in Flask.
