# 🔐 Day 5 – Random Password Generator

> *"Repetition isn’t redundancy; it’s mastery in motion."*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- `for` and `while` loops  
- Input validation using loops  
- Lists and random selection (`random.choice`)  
- Using `random.shuffle()` for randomness  
- Building strings dynamically  
- Clean and modular coding practices

### 💡 Project Overview
In this project, you’ll build a **Random Password Generator** using Python loops and the `random` module.  

The user specifies how many **letters**, **symbols**, and **numbers** they want in their password — and the program creates a secure, randomized password accordingly.  

This project helps you understand how to use **loops and lists together** to build dynamic, practical applications.
