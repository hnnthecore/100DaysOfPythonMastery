## 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Event-driven programming with Tkinter  
- Measuring response time using high-precision timers  
- Tracking keyboard behavior (Backspace detection)  
- Psychological heuristics & scoring logic  
- GUI-based user interaction  
- Clean functional program structure

## 💡 Project Overview
**Digital Lie Detector** is a fun, psychology-inspired GUI application that analyzes **how** a user answers — not **what** they answer.

Instead of detecting lies directly, the program measures **micro-behaviors** such as:
- Response delay  
- Typing hesitation  
- Corrections while answering  

Using these signals, it classifies each response as **Confident** or **Hesitant**, and provides a final confidence analysis at the end of the test.

⚠️ This project is for educational and entertainment purposes only.
