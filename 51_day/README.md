### 💡 Project Overview
**TaskBoard** is a desktop sticky-notes application that lets you visually organize ideas, tasks, reminders, and anything you want to jot down quickly.

You can create colorful pastel sticky notes, drag them anywhere on the canvas, edit or delete them with a right-click menu, and the entire board automatically saves to a JSON file so your layout is restored the next time you open the app.

This creates a Notion-style, Trello-like offline productivity board—simple, elegant, and surprisingly powerful.
