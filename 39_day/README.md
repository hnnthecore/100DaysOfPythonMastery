## 💡 Project Overview
**JobScraper** is a command-line web scraper that collects job listings from a public demo website created by RealPython: [https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/](https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/)


The scraper automatically:

- Downloads all job listings  
- Extracts job title, company, location, and apply link  
- Handles multiple pages using pagination  
- Saves all results to a `jobs.csv` file  
- Prints a preview of the first few jobs in the terminal  

This project builds essential scraping fundamentals that prepare you for advanced tools like Selenium.
