### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Procedural generation and randomness  
- Hierarchical data structures (galaxy → system → planet → moon)  
- JSON serialization and file export  
- Algorithmic name generation using syllable combinations  
- ASCII-based visualization of structured data  
- Modular and readable Python architecture

### 💡 Project Overview
**StarGen** procedurally creates a fictional galaxy with multiple star systems, each containing stars, planets, and moons.  
Every system is unique — generated using random data such as spectral class, orbital distance, and temperature.

It outputs a complete **console catalog** and a detailed **JSON file**, giving you a digital universe ready to explore or extend into future simulations.
