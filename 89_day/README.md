# 🧭 Day 89 – Log Analysis & Anomaly Detection Engine

> *“If you don’t read your logs, your system is lying to you.”*

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Log parsing and text processing  
- Converting unstructured data into structured data  
- Pattern detection using counters  
- Identifying anomalies in system behavior  
- Separation of concerns (parser, analyzer, orchestrator)  
- Real-world debugging and observability concepts  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
This project is a **Log Analysis & Anomaly Detection Engine** designed to simulate how real backend and DevOps tools inspect system logs.

The program:
- Reads raw log files generated by applications  
- Parses each log line into structured data  
- Analyzes log levels, frequency, and repetition  
- Detects suspicious patterns such as repeated errors  
- Generates a readable diagnostic report  

This is **not a game** or simulation — it reflects how production systems monitor health and reliability.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Build tools that analyze real system data  
- Detect anomalies without machine learning  
- Design modular analysis pipelines  
- Work with timestamps and structured logs  
- Understand the foundations of observability systems  
- Debug issues using data instead of guesswork  

These concepts are widely used in **backend engineering, DevOps, and site reliability engineering (SRE)**.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed  
2. Create a `sample.log` file in the project folder  
3. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python main.py
