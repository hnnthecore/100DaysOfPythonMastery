### 💡 Project Overview
**Text Summarizer** condenses long passages into concise, readable summaries using a simple **frequency-based ranking algorithm**.  
You can paste any text or upload a `.txt` file — the program extracts key sentences and saves the result automatically as a `.txt` summary.  
Every run is logged in `summarizer_log.json` with a timestamp and short preview for tracking progress.
