### 💡 Project Overview
**MindTact** is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game where you face off against an *unbeatable AI*.  
Powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, the AI evaluates every possible future move, ensuring it always plays optimally.  
You can draw at best — winning is nearly impossible.

The project demonstrates how Python can simulate intelligent decision-making and implement strategic reasoning in games.
