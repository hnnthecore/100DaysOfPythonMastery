### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Class-based simulation design
- Random movement & state management
- Energy mechanics and resource interaction
- Console visualization (grid-based world)
- Time-step simulation and updates

### 💡 Project Overview
**BioSim** is a simple console-based ecosystem simulation that visualizes life as a collection of small digital creatures.  
Each creature roams randomly on a grid, consumes food to survive, and loses energy as time passes.  
The goal? See which creatures survive longest and how their environment evolves over time.

This project introduces simulation loops, randomness, and OOP — all working together in an engaging way.

### ⚙️ Features
✅ Creatures move randomly on a 10×10 grid  
✅ Energy increases when they find food and decreases on movement  
✅ Food respawns periodically to maintain ecosystem balance  
✅ Simulation continues through multiple “ticks” (time steps)  
✅ Fully console-rendered with a live grid display
