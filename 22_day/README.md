# 📊 Day 22 – AlgoVision: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

> *"See algorithms come to life — one step at a time."*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Visualization of sorting algorithms in Python  
- Step-by-step rendering using loops and delays  
- CLI-based animation and terminal formatting  
- Understanding algorithm efficiency through visualization  
- Modular programming and user-driven interaction  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
**AlgoVision** is an interactive terminal-based sorting visualizer that brings algorithms to life.  
It demonstrates how popular sorting methods transform unsorted data step by step — helping you *see* the logic behind the code.

Each algorithm redraws the array after every key step, allowing you to understand how data gets sorted in real-time.

### ⚙️ Features
✅ Visualize multiple sorting algorithms (Bubble, Insertion, Quick Sort)  
✅ Real-time terminal animation with bar heights  
✅ Randomized input data for every run  
✅ Simple CLI-based interface with instant restart  
✅ No external libraries — runs fully offline
