# ⏳ Day 3 – Strings, Slicing & The Time Traveler’s Code

> *“Those who master strings can bend time itself — because every message is just data waiting to be rewritten.”*  

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- String Indexing & Slicing  
- Built-in String Methods (`lower()`, `upper()`, `replace()`, `count()`)  
- Reversing Strings using `[::-1]`  
- Counting characters and vowels with loops & `sum()`  
- f-Strings for formatted output

### 💡 Project Overview
You’ve discovered an ancient device once used by time travelers.  
It asks for a **secret phrase** and transforms it into a *time-coded message* readable only by those who understand the Pythonic art of string manipulation.  

This project helps reinforce your understanding of slicing, replacement, and pattern transformations in strings.
