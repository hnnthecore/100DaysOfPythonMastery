# 🧭 Day 91 – Smart Text Analyzer

> *“Sometimes the most useful tools are the simplest ones.”*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- String processing in Python  
- Text normalization and cleanup  
- Regular expressions (`re`)  
- Frequency analysis using dictionaries  
- Clean function-based program design  
- Writing lightweight and efficient scripts  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Smart Text Analyzer** is a lightweight Python tool that extracts meaningful insights from raw text.

Given a simple text file, the program analyzes:
- Total number of words  
- Total number of sentences  
- Average words per sentence  
- Most frequently used words  

This project focuses on **clarity, efficiency, and usefulness**, without heavy computation or complex dependencies.

It’s designed to run instantly, even on low-resource systems.
