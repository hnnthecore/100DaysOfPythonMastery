### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Multi-agent system design  
- Emergent behavior in simulations  
- Shared environment modeling  
- Resource contention and competition  
- Priority-based decision logic  
- Game-theory inspired survival mechanics  
- Autonomous agent interaction

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Multi-Agent Survival Arena** is an advanced simulation where multiple AI agents coexist in a shared, resource-limited environment.

Each agent:
- Has identical decision logic  
- Competes for the same food and water  
- Responds to increasing danger  
- Makes independent survival decisions  

No agent is scripted to win.  
The outcome is determined entirely by **interaction, timing, and emergent behavior**.

This project focuses on **systems that evolve through interaction**, not linear execution.

### 🧩 Sample Output

- Multiple agents acting every turn  
- Shared world state affecting all decisions  
- Agents dying at different stages  
- One survivor emerging — or none  

This demonstrates a full **multi-agent → competition → emergence → outcome** simulation.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Build simulations involving multiple autonomous agents  
- Design systems where behavior emerges naturally  
- Model competition over limited resources  
- Understand fairness and balance in simulations  
- Apply game-theory concepts without complex math  
- Think beyond single-entity logic  

This project introduces **emergent systems thinking**, a core concept in AI research, games, and complex simulations.
