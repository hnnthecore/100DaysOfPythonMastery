- Simulation-driven decision making  
- Systems and economic thinking

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Economic Simulation Engine** models a simplified economy where agents interact through production, consumption, and pricing.

The system includes:
- **Producers** who generate goods  
- **Consumers** who purchase goods to survive  
- A shared **market** where supply and demand influence prices  

As the simulation progresses, prices fluctuate based on demand pressure.  
If resources become scarce or prices rise too high, consumers begin to fail — potentially leading to total economic collapse.

This project focuses on **behavioral economics and system feedback**, not financial calculations or user interfaces.

### 🧩 Sample Output

- Dynamic price changes based on demand  
- Producers and consumers interacting in real time  
- Agents surviving or dying based on economic conditions  
- Collapse scenario when consumers can no longer survive  

This demonstrates a complete **produce → consume → adjust → collapse/stabilize** cycle.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Model supply and demand using simple rules  
- Simulate economic behavior with autonomous agents  
- Implement feedback loops that influence system stability  
- Observe emergent patterns in markets  
- Design simulations that can fail naturally  
- Think in terms of economic systems rather than transactions  

This project builds **economic and systems-level reasoning**, used in simulations, games, and policy modeling.
