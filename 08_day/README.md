### ðŸ§  Concepts Practised
- Dictionaries for structured data  
- Nested functions and modular logic  
- Resource tracking and management  
- `while True` loops for continuous programs  
- Input validation and user interaction  
- Simulating real-world systems with code  

---

### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
The **Coffee Machine Simulator** models a real cafÃ© machine that:
- Offers a menu (`espresso`, `latte`, `cappuccino`)  
- Tracks ingredients (water, milk, coffee) and money  
- Processes payments using coins  
- Checks for sufficient resources before serving drinks  
- Generates a live machine report  

This project blends **logic, structure, and interactivity**, making it feel like a real system running in your terminal.
