### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Tkinter canvas-based UI design  
- Node-based graphical interfaces  
- Drag-and-drop mechanics  
- Dynamic line drawing for connections  
- Editable text nodes  
- Right-click contextual actions  
- Exporting canvas to PNG using Pillow  
- Storing and managing in-app objects (nodes, edges)

### 💡 Project Overview
**MindSketch** is a graphical mind-mapping tool built entirely with Python and Tkinter.

You can:
- Create concept nodes  
- Drag them freely across the canvas  
- Connect any two nodes using arrows  
- Edit node text  
- Delete nodes  
- Export the entire mind map as a **PNG image**

It works fully offline and behaves like a lightweight version of Miro or MindMeister — making it a unique and highly visual desktop application.
