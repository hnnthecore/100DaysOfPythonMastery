### ðŸ§  Concepts Practised
- File handling (`open`, `write`, `read`, `append`)  
- Loops and data parsing  
- Working with **dates and timestamps**  
- Creating and formatting **CSV files**  
- Category-based data analysis  

---

### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
The **Expense Tracker** helps users record, view, and analyze their daily expenses.  
Each entry is saved to a `expenses.csv` file, allowing your data to persist even after the program ends.

Users can:
- Add new expense entries  
- View all expenses in a clean table format  
- Check the total amount spent  
- View category-wise spending summaries  

This project introduces **persistent storage**, a key step toward data-driven applications.
