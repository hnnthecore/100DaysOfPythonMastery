### 💡 Project Overview
**NumbrIQ** is a smart command-line math assistant that doesn’t just solve problems —  
it **explains every step** of how it gets there.  
It simplifies, evaluates, and solves equations or symbolic expressions using the `sympy` library.  

Every solved problem is stored in a local history file, so you can review or reuse your calculations anytime.

### ⚙️ Features
✅ Parses and simplifies any mathematical expression  
✅ Explains simplification and evaluation steps  
✅ Supports derivatives (`diff`) and integrals (`integrate`)  
✅ Automatically saves all steps in a JSON file  
✅ Works 100% offline — no API calls required
