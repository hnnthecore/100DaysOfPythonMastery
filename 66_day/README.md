> *"A web app becomes real when users can talk back."*

---


### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Handling user input using HTML forms  
- Understanding GET vs POST requests  
- Using Flask’s `request` object  
- Processing form data on the backend  
- Integrating Bootstrap via CDN  
- Styling forms using Bootstrap classes  
- Connecting backend logic with frontend UI  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
This project introduces **user interaction in Flask** using HTML forms.

For the first time in the Flask journey, the application:
- Accepts input from the user  
- Sends data from the browser to Python  
- Processes the input on the backend  
- Displays a dynamic response on the page  

Bootstrap is integrated to enhance the UI **without affecting backend logic**, demonstrating how styling and functionality remain independent.

- User enters their name in a form  
- Data is sent using a POST request  
- Flask processes the input and responds dynamically  
- Bootstrap provides clean, responsive styling  

This clearly demonstrates **browser → server → response** flow.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Create and handle HTML forms in Flask  
- Differentiate between GET and POST requests  
- Use `request.form` to access user input  
- Build interactive Flask applications  
- Integrate Bootstrap safely using CDN  
- Improve UI without changing backend logic  

These skills are fundamental for real-world web applications.
