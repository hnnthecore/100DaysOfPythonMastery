# 🧭 Day 93 – Interactive Data Visualization Playground

> *“Understanding data starts with seeing it.”*

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- GUI development using Tkinter  
- Canvas-based drawing and rendering  
- Coordinate system and layout math  
- Mapping data values to visual elements  
- Dynamic UI updates based on user input  
- Separating visualization logic from input handling  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Interactive Data Visualization Playground** is a GUI-based tool that transforms raw numeric input into a visual representation.

Users can:
- Enter a list of numbers  
- Instantly visualize the data as a bar chart  
- See values mapped proportionally onto the screen  
- Interact with visual output rather than plain text  

Unlike basic GUI utilities, this project focuses on **how data becomes visuals**, introducing concepts used in dashboards, analytics tools, and charting libraries.

- Bars scaled relative to the largest value  
- Clean Canvas-based rendering  
- Dynamic redraw on every input change  
- Numeric labels positioned visually  

This demonstrates how **data-to-pixel mapping** works internally.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Use Tkinter’s `Canvas` for custom graphics  
- Convert numeric data into proportional visuals  
- Work with screen coordinates and scaling logic  
- Build interactive visualization tools without external libraries  
- Think visually about data instead of textually  

These concepts form the foundation of **data visualization, dashboards, and UI-driven analytics**.
