# 🧭 Day 85 – Procedural World Generator (Simulation Engine)

> *“Worlds don’t need artists — they need rules.”*

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Procedural generation techniques  
- Simulation-based system design  
- Rule-driven randomness  
- World state modeling  
- Event-driven architecture  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Engine-style code organization  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Procedural World Generator** is a simulation engine that creates a unique world every time it runs.

Each generated world includes:
- A randomly selected biome  
- Dynamic resources such as food, water, gold, and wood  
- A danger level that evolves over time  
- Random world events that influence stability  

As time progresses, the world changes organically, simulating how environments evolve due to both natural growth and disruptive events.

This project focuses on **systems and simulation logic**, rather than user interfaces or databases.

### 🧩 Sample Output

- Unique world created on every run  
- Resources fluctuating over simulated years  
- Random environmental events altering outcomes  
- World collapse when danger exceeds safe limits  

This demonstrates a full **generate → simulate → evolve → collapse** lifecycle.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Design procedural systems using rules instead of scripts  
- Build simulation engines with evolving state  
- Use controlled randomness to create variation  
- Model real-world systems in code  
- Separate world logic from event logic  
- Think like a game or systems engineer  

This project builds foundational skills used in **games, AI environments, and complex simulations**.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed  
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Advance time and observe how the world evolves
4. Explore different outcomes on every run
