### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Random sequence generation and mutation simulation  
- Complementary base pairing logic (A↔T, G↔C)  
- Iterative updates and terminal-based animation  
- Loop control, mutation probability, and timing  
- Clear ASCII-based scientific visualization in Python

### 💡 Project Overview
**GenePy** is a dynamic terminal simulation of DNA mutation and replication.  
Each generation creates a new DNA strand based on the previous one, applying random mutations according to a configurable mutation rate.

You can visually observe:
- DNA → complementary strand alignment  
- gradual random mutations across generations  
- how biological randomness can be represented through code  

This project merges **biology and programming logic** in a concise and visual way.
