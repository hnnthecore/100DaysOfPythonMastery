## 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Event-driven GUI programming with Tkinter  
- Measuring reaction time under cognitive stress  
- Handling time-limited user input  
- Game state management across multiple rounds  
- Accuracy vs speed scoring logic  
- Difficulty progression through mental conflict  

---

## 💡 Project Overview
**Cognitive Load Reaction Test** is a psychology-inspired interactive game that measures how mental pressure affects human performance.

Instead of testing simple reflexes, this project intentionally creates **cognitive conflict** (word vs color mismatch) and tracks:
- Reaction time  
- Accuracy  
- Performance degradation over multiple rounds  

At the end of the test, the user receives a **cognitive load verdict** based on speed and correctness.
