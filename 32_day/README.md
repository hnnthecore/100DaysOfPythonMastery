## 💡 Project Overview
**LinguaMatch** is a Swiss–English flashcard trainer that automatically flips cards and remembers which words you have learned.

When the app starts, it shows a Swiss word.  
After 3 seconds, the card flips to show the English translation.

If you press **✓ (Known)**, the word is removed from your learning list and saved to a CSV so your progress continues the next time you open the app.
