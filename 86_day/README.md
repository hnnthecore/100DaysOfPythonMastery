### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Agent-based system design  
- Heuristic decision-making  
- Priority-driven logic  
- Autonomous simulations  
- Environment–agent interaction  
- State evaluation and survival conditions  
- Foundations of artificial intelligence reasoning

### 💡 Project Overview
The **AI Survival Agent** is an autonomous simulation where a computer-controlled agent attempts to survive in a changing environment.

The agent continuously:
- Observes the environment  
- Evaluates its internal state (hunger, energy, health)  
- Chooses the best possible action  
- Adapts to increasing danger and limited resources  

There is **no user input** — the program runs entirely on its own.  
Survival depends purely on **decision quality**, making this a foundational AI-style system.

### 🧩 Sample Output

- Autonomous turns with no player interaction  
- Actions selected based on priorities  
- Dynamic environment changes over time  
- Eventual survival or failure based on decisions  

This demonstrates a complete **observe → decide → act → survive** loop.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Design intelligent agents using logic instead of machine learning  
- Implement heuristic-based decision systems  
- Model environments that evolve over time  
- Build autonomous simulations  
- Separate decision logic from world rules  
- Understand how real game bots and AI systems operate  

This project introduces **true AI foundations**, without relying on external libraries or models.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed  
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python main.py
3. Observe the agent’s decisions and survival behavior
4. Rerun the program to see different outcomes
