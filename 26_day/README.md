### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Neural network structure and data flow  
- Feedforward computation and activations  
- Sigmoid function for activation scaling  
- Randomized input simulation  
- Real-time visualization using `matplotlib.animation`  
- Clean modular design for simulation logic

### 💡 Project Overview
**NeuralInk** visualizes how information flows through a simple **feedforward neural network**.  
Each frame shows random input data passing through layers, while neuron colors indicate activation intensity — bright nodes fire strongly, dim nodes stay inactive.  

This project helps visualize the **core logic of deep learning**: inputs → weights → activations → outputs,  
making the math behind AI visually understandable.

### ⚙️ Features
✅ Procedural visualization of a 4-layer neural network  
✅ Animated activation flow for every frame  
✅ Real-time updates with smooth color transitions  
✅ Scalable architecture — easily change number of layers or neurons  
✅ Pure Python + Matplotlib, no deep learning frameworks required
