### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Real-time audio recording using `sounddevice`  
- Waveform visualization with `matplotlib`  
- Multithreading for live UI updates  
- Audio normalization and WAV export  
- GUI application design with Tkinter  
- Playback of recorded audio  
- Data handling with NumPy arrays  
- Non-blocking asynchronous callbacks

### 💡 Project Overview
**AudioDesk** is a professional-grade desktop recorder that captures microphone audio in real time and displays a live waveform visualization as you speak.

You can:
- Start and stop recording at any time  
- Instantly playback what you recorded  
- Save the recording as a `.wav` file  
- Watch the waveform animate in real time  
- Use the interface fully offline  

This is a polished, realistic application — ideal for Day 52 and a strong addition to any portfolio.
