# 🧭 Day 96 – Data → Insight Engine (CSV Analyzer)

> *“Data is useless until it tells a story.”*

---


### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Working with CSV files in Python  
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Detecting numeric vs categorical data  
- Aggregation and basic statistics  
- Frequency analysis using dictionaries  
- Separating data logic from reporting  
- Writing clean, readable analysis scripts  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Data → Insight Engine** is a lightweight data analysis tool that converts raw CSV data into **human-readable insights**.

Instead of visualizing or plotting data, this project focuses on **understanding the structure and meaning of data** through programmatic analysis.

The engine:
- Loads a CSV file  
- Automatically detects column types  
- Computes statistics for numeric columns  
- Finds common values in text columns  
- Outputs a clean, structured insight report  

This mirrors the **first step of real data analysis workflows** before dashboards or machine learning.

- Clear per-column insight breakdown  
- Automatic detection of data types  
- Summary statistics for numeric fields  
- Frequency insights for categorical data  

This demonstrates how raw datasets can be **quickly audited and understood**.

---

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Read and process structured data using Python  
- Identify data types dynamically  
- Perform basic statistical analysis  
- Extract insights instead of raw values  
- Build analysis tools without heavy libraries  

This project strengthens your ability to **reason about data**, not just manipulate it.

### 🚀 Run the Program
1. Ensure Python is installed  
2. Create or edit `data.csv` with sample data  
3. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   python main.py
