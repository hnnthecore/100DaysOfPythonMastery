### 💡 Project Overview
**TimeBlock** is a desktop daily planner designed to help you visually organize your day using draggable time blocks.  
Unlike standard todo apps, TimeBlock gives you a *timeline-based* layout similar to Google Calendar, where each task is represented as a colored block that you can move up and down to adjust its time slot.

You can:
- Add new task blocks  
- Drag them anywhere along the timeline  
- Edit the text on any block  
- Delete blocks with one click  
- Save your day’s layout  
- Reload your saved schedule on startup  

The entire experience is smooth, visual, and fully offline.
