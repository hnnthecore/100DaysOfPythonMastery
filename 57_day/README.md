## 💡 Project Overview
This project focuses on **offline data automation**, simulating a real-world scenario where raw data is inconsistent, incomplete, or poorly formatted.

The program:
- Loads raw data from CSV and JSON files
- Cleans and standardizes the data
- Generates meaningful summaries
- Exports processed results
- Displays output through a simple GUI

This project avoids browser automation and external dependencies, keeping the focus on **logic, structure, and reliability**.
