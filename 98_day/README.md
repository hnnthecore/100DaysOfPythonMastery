# 🧭 Day 98 – AI Personal Knowledge Engine (Reasoning + Memory)

> *“Intelligence is not memorization — it’s knowing what matters when asked.”*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- AI-inspired reasoning systems  
- Text preprocessing and keyword extraction  
- Semantic similarity and scoring  
- Rule-based ranking and selection  
- Explainable AI outputs  
- Persistent knowledge storage  
- Designing systems with memory and logic  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **AI Personal Knowledge Engine** is a lightweight, local AI-style system that stores knowledge and answers user questions through **semantic reasoning**, not hardcoded responses.

Instead of relying on machine learning libraries, this project demonstrates how **early expert systems and modern AI agents work internally**:
- Information is stored as structured knowledge  
- User questions are analyzed for intent  
- Relevant knowledge is scored and ranked  
- The best answer is returned with an explanation  

This project focuses on **reasoning, transparency, and system design**, not black-box AI.

### 🧩 Sample Output
![AI Knowledge Engine Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hnnthecore/100DaysOfPythonMastery/refs/heads/main/assets/day98_output.png)

- User asks a natural language question  
- The engine selects the most relevant knowledge  
- Matched terms are shown for explainability  
- A confidence score is provided  

This demonstrates **interpretable, explainable AI behavior**.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Build AI-inspired systems without ML frameworks  
- Store and structure reusable knowledge  
- Perform semantic matching using scoring logic  
- Rank multiple candidates to find the best answer  
- Explain *why* an answer was chosen  
- Design systems that separate memory, logic, and interaction  

These concepts are foundational to **AI agents, recommendation systems, and expert systems**.
