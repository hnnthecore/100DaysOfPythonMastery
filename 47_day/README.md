### 💡 Project Overview
**AutoTranslateMail** is a dual-pane desktop application that converts email drafts into multiple international languages with a single click.

Unlike ordinary translators, this tool is built for *long email writing*, preserving tone and paragraph spacing — making it ideal for formal outreach, cold-mailing, corporate writing or multilingual correspondence.

Users type on the left, select a target language, and translation appears instantly in the right panel.
