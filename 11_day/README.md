### ðŸ§  Concepts Practised
- Dictionaries and nested data structures  
- Conditional and nested loops  
- Randomized events using `random.choice()`  
- Modular functions for structured gameplay  
- Interactive storytelling logic  
- Time-based text effects using `time.sleep()`

### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
**Escape the Labyrinth** is a text-based adventure game where you wake up in a mysterious maze, surrounded by darkness.  
You must explore rooms, choose paths wisely, and survive traps, whispers, and strange events â€” all before your torch burns out.

Each room connects to others in different directions, and your decisions determine whether you find **freedomâ€¦ or oblivion.**

### ðŸ”¦ Torch Mechanic
You have a limited number of moves before your torch extinguishes.  
Every action reduces the torch timer â€” so think fast and choose wisely.

### ðŸ§  Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Structure a multi-room game using dictionaries  
- Implement randomness and replayability  
- Add story depth with functions and event triggers  
- Combine logic, timing, and creative writing in one script
