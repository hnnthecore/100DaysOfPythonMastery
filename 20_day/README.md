### 💡 Project Overview
**CodeCanvas** is an interactive drawing pad built using Python’s `turtle` module.  
It allows users to create geometric art — from simple shapes like squares and circles to complex spirals and randomized abstract designs.

Every time you run the program, it generates unique patterns and color combinations, blending programming logic with creativity.
