### ðŸ§  Concepts Practised
- **Random number generation** with `random.randint()`  
- **ASCII Art rendering** for visuals  
- **Loops and iteration logic**  
- **Time-based animations** using `time.sleep()` and `itertools`  
- **File handling** to log each session (`dice_log.txt`)  
- **Data tracking** for total rolls, averages, and highest score

### ðŸ’¡ Project Overview
The **Advanced Dice Roll Game** takes the classic dice simulator to the next level â€”  
you can roll multiple dice, watch them spin with animated effects, and track your session stats in real time.  

Each roll is logged with a timestamp, and your session summary shows:
- Total number of dice rolled  
- Average roll value  
- Highest total rolled in the session

### ðŸ“œ Dice Log File
Every session automatically creates or updates a `dice_log.txt` file that stores your results:

### ðŸ§  Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Use `itertools` and `sys` for smooth console animation  
- Display visual output dynamically with ASCII art  
- Build persistent data logging with timestamps  
- Maintain real-time statistics in an interactive game loop
