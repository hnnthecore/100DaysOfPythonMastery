### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Building advanced forms using Flask-WTForms  
- Using multiple WTForms fields (String, Email, TextArea)  
- Applying built-in WTForms validators  
- Structuring reusable form classes  
- Integrating WTForms cleanly with Bootstrap  
- Creating scalable and maintainable form systems

### 💡 Project Overview
This project takes form handling to the **next professional level** using **Flask-WTForms and Bootstrap**.

Instead of manually validating user input, the application now:
- Defines validation rules declaratively  
- Uses reusable form classes  
- Automatically handles validation and errors  
- Produces cleaner, more maintainable Flask routes  

The result is a **production-style form architecture** suitable for real applications.
