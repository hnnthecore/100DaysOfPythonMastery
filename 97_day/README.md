# 🧭 Day 97 – Smart Decision Advisor (Rule-Based Engine)

> *“Good decisions come from structured thinking.”*

---

### 🧠 Concepts Practised
- Rule-based logic systems  
- Conditional decision-making  
- Weighted scoring mechanisms  
- User input validation  
- Function-based program architecture  
- Explainable logic and reasoning  
- Translating real-world choices into code  

---

### 💡 Project Overview
The **Smart Decision Advisor** is a lightweight, interactive Python program that helps users make decisions based on their personal priorities.

Instead of hardcoded outcomes, the system:
- Collects user preferences through guided questions  
- Applies weighted rules to different options  
- Scores each possible path  
- Recommends the most suitable choice  
- Explains *why* that choice was selected  

This project focuses on **logic, reasoning, and clarity**, not UI or backend complexity.

- Interactive question-based flow  
- Clear scoring breakdown for each option  
- A single recommended path  
- Transparent explanation of the decision  

This demonstrates how rule-based systems can guide choices in a logical, explainable way.

### 🧠 Key Learning
You learned how to:
- Design rule-based decision engines  
- Convert subjective preferences into measurable inputs  
- Apply weighted scoring to multiple outcomes  
- Keep decision logic transparent and explainable  
- Build adaptable systems that can be reused for different domains  

These concepts are commonly used in **recommendation systems, expert systems, and decision-support tools**.
